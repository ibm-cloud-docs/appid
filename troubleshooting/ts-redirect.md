# Why is my user not redirected to my app? 
{: #ts-redirect}
{: troubleshoot}

{{site.data.keyword.appid_full}} is deprecated. As of 01 May 2024, you can't create new instances, and access to free instances will be removed. Existing instances are supported until 01 October 2025. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted. {: deprecated}

When a user signs into your app by using {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}, they are redirected back to your application, but occasionally a redirect might fail.
{: shortdesc}


If your redirect URL is rejected by the service when you enter it in the UI, be sure that it is a valid URL that is formatted correctly. [Learn more](/docs/appid?topic=appid-managing-idp#add-redirect-uri).
{: tip}


## Why isn't a user redirected to my application after they sign-in by using an identity provider?
{: #ts-signin-fail}
{: support}

A user signs in to your application through an identity provider's sign in page, and either nothing happens or the sign-in fails.
{: tsSymptoms}

Sign-in might fail for the following reasons:
{: tsCauses}

* Your redirect URL was not properly added to [the allow list](/docs/appid?topic=appid-faq#faq-redirect).
* The user is not authorized.
* The user tried to sign in with the wrong credentials.

For a redirect to occur:
{: tsResolve}

* Verify that your redirect URL is correct. It must be exact for the redirect to work.
* Be sure that your user is signing in with the correct credentials
* Check that they're configured in your identity provider user settings.


## Why isn't a user redirected to an identity provider when they try to sign-in?
{: #ts-redirect-idp}

A user tries to sign in to your application, but the sign-in page doesn't display when prompted.
{: tsSymptoms}

The identity provider can fail for several reasons:
{: tsCauses}

* The redirect URI that is listed in {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} is written incorrectly.
* The identity provider doesn't recognize the authentication request.
* The identity provider expects HTTP-POST binding.
* The identity provider expects a signed AuthnRequest.

You can try some of these solutions:
{: tsResolve}

* Update your sign-in URL. This URL is sent as part of the `AuthnRequest` and must be exact.
* Be sure that your {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} metadata is set correctly in your identity provider settings.
* Configure your identity provider to accept the `AuthnRequest` in the HTTP-Redirect.
* {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} does not support signing `AuthnRequests`.

If none of these solutions work, it is possible that they might have a connection issue.
