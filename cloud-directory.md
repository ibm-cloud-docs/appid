# Cloud Directory
{: #cd}

With {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}, users can sign up and sign in to your mobile and web apps by using an email or username and a password. A cloud directory is a user registry that is maintained in the cloud. When a user signs up for your app, they're added to your directory of users. With this feature, users have the freedom to manage their own account within your app.
{: shortdesc}

</br>

## Managing directory settings
{: #cd-settings}

You can configure the notifications and level of user control for your app. Setting up cloud directory can be done quickly, as shown in the following image. These settings can be updated at any time from the service dashboard.
{: shortdesc}


![Configuring cloud directory](images/cloud-directory.png)
Figure. The configuration journey for Cloud Directory

1. In the **Manage** tab of the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} dashboard, be sure that Cloud Directory is set to **On**.

2. Configure your general settings.
  1. Decide whether you want your users to create a username or use their email when they sign in. Both options require a password. After users have been added to your directory, you can no longer toggle between the options.
  2. Click **Edit** in the password criteria row to specify any requirements that you want to put in place. Password criteria is given as regex. For help determining strength or to see common examples see, [Managing password strength](#strength). Click **Save** to put your requirements into action.
  3. Set **Allow users to sign up to your app** to **Yes**. You can still add users through the console if it's set to **No**. However, you should add users through the console only for development purposes.
  4. Set **Allow users to manage their account from your app** to **Yes** if you want your users to be able to reset their password, change their password, or reset their details. If you want to limit your users self-service, set the value to **No**.
  5. Click **Edit** in the **Sender details** row to update your email settings. The email settings apply for all of the communication that is sent through {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}. Specify the email address that should send the email, their name, and leave a separate email for users to send a response.
  6. Click **Save**.

3. Configure your verification email settings.
  1. To have your users verify their email address set **Email verification** to **On**. When a user signs up for your application, they receive an email that asks them to confirm that they've signed up for the app.
  2. If you've decided that you want your users to verify their email, your next decision is whether you want to allow users into your application prior to them verifying their email address. Depending on your preference, set **Allow users to sign in to your app without first verifying their email address** to **Yes** or **No**.
  3. Customize the content and design the appearance of your message. There is a template for the message, but you can update the text with your own message. You can use a [language](/docs/services/appid/cloud-directory.html#languages) other than English, but you are responsible for the translation of the text. To choose another language, use the <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/updateLocalization" target="_blank">language management APIs <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.
  4. Give the verification URL an expiration time limit, specified as minutes.  When this time is set here, it also affects the length of time that your reset password link is valid for.
  5. Enter your own verification page URL if you have a specific page that you want your users to see when they click the link. If you leave the **Custom verification page URL** field blank, a default verification page is provided by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}.
  6. Click **Save**.

4. Configure your welcome email settings.
  1. To welcome users through email when they sign up for your app, set **Welcome email** to **On**.
  2. Customize the content and design the appearance of your message. There is an example message that you can use, but you can update the text with your own message. You can use a [language](#languages) other than English, but you are responsible for the translation of the text. To choose another language, use the <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/updateLocalization" target="_blank">language management APIs <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.
  3. Click **Save**.

5. Configure your password reset settings.
  1. To allow users to request a reset of their password, set **Forgot password email** to **On**. **Note**: A user must have validated their email prior to reseting their password. This means that you must require email verification to allow password resets.
  2. Customize the content and design the appearance of your message. There is an example message that you can use, but you can update the text with your own message. You can use a [language](#languages) other than English, but you are responsible for the translation of the text. To choose another language, use the <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/updateLocalization" target="_blank">language management APIs <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.
  3. Give the reset password URL an expiration time limit, specified as minutes. When this time is set here, it also affects the length of time that your email verification link is valid for.
  4. Enter your own password reset URL if you have a specific page that you want your users to see when they click the link. If you leave the **Reset password page URL** field blank, a default reset password page is provided by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}.
  5. Click **Save**.

6. Configure your change password settings.
  1. To notify users about any changes made to their password, set **Password changed email** to **On**.
  2. Customize the content and design the appearance of your message. There is an example message that you can use, but you can update the text with your own message. You can use a [language](#languages) other than English, but you are responsible for the translation of the text. To choose another language, use the <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/updateLocalization" target="_blank">language management APIs <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.
  3. Click **Save**.

7. In the **Users** tab you can see who has signed-up for your app. Note: A single user can attempt to sign in up to 5 times in 60 seconds. If a sixth attempt is made, an error is displayed.

</br>
</br>

## Types of messages
{: #types}

You can send several types of messages to your users. You can choose to send the example message that is provided by the service or you can customize the content for a more personal app experience. {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} uses <a href="https://www.sendgrid.com" target="_blank">SendGrid <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> as a mail delivery service. All emails are sent with a single SendGrid account.

If a user does not supply the information pulled by the parameter, it appears blank.

## Managing password strength
{: #strength}

You can set the requirements for the passwords that can be used with Cloud Directory.
{: shortdesc}

A strong password makes it difficult, or even improbable for someone to guess the password in either a manual or automated way. Password strength is set as a regex string.

Some common password strength examples:

- Must be at least 8 characters. Example regex: `^.{8,}$`
- Must contain 1 number, 1 lower case letter, and 1 capital letter. Example regex: `^(?:(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).*)$`
- Must contain only English letters and numbers. Example regex: `^[A-Za-z0-9]*$`
- Must be at least 1 unique character. Example regex: `^(\w)\w*?(?!\1)\w+$`

You must use <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/set_cloud_directory_password_regex" target="_blank">the management APIs <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> to set the requirements.

## Using a custom email sender
{: #custom-email}

With {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}, you can define a custom extension point to send your Cloud Directory email messages. By defining an extension point, you have full control of how the emails are sent and you can use your own domain name.
 {: shortdesc}

**Why would I want to use a custom email sender?**

By default, {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} uses SendGrid to deliver messages on your behalf. By configuring your own custom email sender, you can further enhance the branded experience for your app users.

Some more specific examples:
- **Personalized domain**
By configuring a custom email dispatcher, you have full control over how the email messages are sent. This includes customising the email domain which may further reduce the chances of emails being filtered as spam.
- **Insights and troubleshooting**
Gain insights from your email provider, such as: the number of people that opened the emails or which messages were not delivered. Because you can track individual messages, and see overall statistics, this can help solve issues.

</br>

**How does it work?**

After the extension point is configured, it is called by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} whenever an email message needs to be sent. The extension point contains all of the information about the message, including the final content of the email body.

</br>

**To create a custom email sender:**

1. In order to configure the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance to use custom disparcher, use <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/set_cloud_directory_email_dispatcher" target="_blank">the management API </a>.</br>
You must provide the URL, Additionaly you may provide authorization information. The supported authorization types are:  `Basic authorization` or a `constant authorization header value`.

  Valid configuration examples:
  ```
  {
    "custom": {
      "url": "https://example.com/send_mail"
    }
  }
  ```
  {: screen}

  ```
  {
    "custom": {
      "url": "https://example.com/send_mail",
      "authorization": {
        "type": "basic",
        "username": "username",
        "password": "password"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  {: screen}

  ```
  {
    "custom": {
      "url": "https://example.com/send_mail",
      "authorization": {
        "type": "value",
        "value": "myApiKey"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  {: screen}

2. Configure an extension point that can listen to post request. This endpoint should be able to read the paload comming from {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} and send the email with your custom email sender.

3. The body sent from {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} is in the following format: `{"jws": "jws-format-string"}`. </br> After you decode and verify the payload, the content is a JSON string.</br>
  ```
    {
      "tenant": "tenant-id",
      "iss" : "appid-oauth.ng.bluemix.net",
      "iat": 1539173126,
      "jti": "uniq-id",
      "message": {
          "to": "your@mail.com",
          "from": {
              "name": "My Awesome Service",
              "address": "no-reply@company.com"
          },
          "replyTo": {
              "name": "My Awesome Service",
              "address": "yes-reply@company.com"
          },
          "subject": "Welcome to My Awesome Service",
          "body": "<p>Hello<p><br/><p>Thanks for signing up John Doe</p>"
      }
    }
  ```
  {: screen}

  - tenant: App ID instance tenantId
  - iat: timestamp of when the message was sent
  - iss: identifies principal that issued the JWS.
  - jti: uniq transaction ID
  - message: message to send, consists of the following fields:
    - to: recepiance email address
    - from: sender information, consists of the following fields:
      - name: optional, sender name
      - address: sender address
    - reply to: optional, consists of the following fields:
      - name: optional, sender name
      - address: optional, sender address
    - subject: email subject
    - body: email body, in html format

  You can verify that your request was successful by checking the response status code. Anything in the range of 200 - 299 is considered a success. If you receive any other response, try to make your request again.
  {: tip}

4. Every HTTP payload that is sent from {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} is automatically signed according to the JWS standard by using an asymmetric key pair.
For every {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance, a private and a public key is generated that are not shared across other instances. The private key is used to sign the HTTP payload, and you can use the public key to verify that the payload is generated by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} and is not altered by a third party, <a href="https://appid-oauth.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Authorization_Server_V3/publicKeys" target="_blank">Public keys endpoint </a>.

5. Example code for the extension point (JavaScript)
  ```
  const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
  const {promisify} = require('bluebird');
  const request = promisify(require('request'));
  const jwtVerify = promisify(require('jsonwebtoken').verify);
  const jwtDecode = require('jsonwebtoken').decode;
  const jwkToPem = require('jwk-to-pem');

  async function obtainPublicKeys() {
  	// Your App ID instance tenant ID
  	const tenantId = '<TENANT-ID>';

  	// Send request to App ID's public keys endpoint
  	const keysOptions = {
  		method: 'GET',
  		url: `https://appid-oauth.<REGION>.bluemix.net/oauth/v3/${tenantId}/publickeys`
  	};
  	const keysResponse = await request(keysOptions);
  	return JSON.parse(keysResponse.body).keys;
  }

  async function verifySignature(keysArray, kid, jws) {
  	const keyJson = keysArray.find(key => key.kid === kid);
  	if (keyJson) {
  		const pem = jwkToPem(keyJson);
  		await jwtVerify(jws, pem);
  		return;
  	}
  	throw new Error ("Unable to verify signature");
  }

  async function verifyAndSendMail(jws) {
  	// The API key for Sendgrid
  	const sgApiKey = '<SENDGRID-API-KEY>';

  	// Init Sendgrind
  	sgMail.setApiKey(sgApiKey);

  	// Decode message to get information
  	const data = jwtDecode(jws, {complete: true});

  	// Extract kid from header
  	const kid = data.header.kid;

  	const keysArray = await obtainPublicKeys();

  	// Verify the signature of the payload with the public keys
  	await verifySignature(keysArray, kid ,jws);

  	// Send the email with Your Sendgrid account
  	const message = data.payload.message;
  	const msg = {
  		to: message.to,
  		from: message.from.address,
  		subject: message.subject,
  		html: message.body,
  	};
  	console.log(`Sending email to ${message.to}`);
  	let sendgridResponse = await sgMail.send(msg);

  	return {result : 'email_sent',sendgridResponse};
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

6. Verify that your configuration is correctly set up by testing your email dispatcher. Use the <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/post_email_dispatcher_test" target="_blank">test API</a> to trigger a request to your configured custom email sender.

For full working example, see <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/10/use-ibm-cloud-app-id-and-your-email-provider-to-brand-mails-sent-to-app-users/" target="_blank">Use your own provider for mail sent with {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}</a>.

</br>
</br>




## Supported languages
{: #languages}

You can use <a href="https://appid-management.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/#!/Config/updateLocalization" target="_blank">the language management APIs <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> to set the language in which your user communication can be written. However, only English is available out of the box. You are responsible for the translation of the messages. After you set the configuration with the API, the GUI updates so that you are able to change the template text.
