# Auditing events for {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}
{: #at-events}

{{site.data.keyword.appid_full}} is deprecated. As of 01 May 2024, you can't create new instances, and access to free instances will be removed. Existing instances are supported until 01 October 2025. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted. {: deprecated}

You can view, manage, and analyze user-initiated activities that are made in your {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}} service instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service.
{: shortdesc}

By integrating {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} with {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}, you can track two different types of events, administrative and runtime. Administrative events are specific to your instance of the service. Administrative events cover configuration changes such as updating your identity providers or changing the theme of your login widget. Runtime events are those activities that occur at run time by the app user. A password reset request, authentication failures, or a user logout would all fall into the runtime category.

For more information about how the service works, see the [{{site.data.keyword.at_short}} docs](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).



## Viewing administrative events
{: #at-monitor-admin}

You can view, manage, and analyze configuration activity that is made in your {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service.
{: shortdesc}

### Monitoring administrative activity
{: #at-monitor-admin-activity}

1. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
2. From the catalog, provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service in the same account and region as your {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance.
3. From the **Observability > Activity Tracker** tab, verify the information for the instance that you created.
4. Click **View Open Dashboard** and make sure you're on the **Everything** dashboard. Any events that meet the qualifications for your {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} payment plan are visible. You can filter your results by tags, sources, apps, or levels. You can also search for specific events or jump to a specific timeframe.

## Viewing runtime events
{: #at-monitor-runtime}

With {{site.data.keyword.at_short}}, you can review runtime activity that is made by an app user, such as logins, password resets, and authentications.
{: shortdesc}

The reported events are per account, but the data rate and retention period of the collected runtime events have limitations. Increasing the limits might require an upgrade of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service. For more information about the service limits, see the [{{site.data.keyword.at_short}} docs](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-service_plan).


### Monitoring runtime activity
{: #at-monitor-runtime-activity}

1. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
2. From the catalog, provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service in the same account as your {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance.
3. In the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} dashboard, click **Manage authentication > Authentication settings**.
4. Scroll to the **Runtime Activity** panel and toggle the switch to enable tracking of runtime authentication activity. A message displays that notifies you that the feature is enabled and that you are charged differently. For more information, see [How does App ID calculate pricing](/docs/appid?topic=appid-pricing).
5. From the **Observability > Activity Tracker** tab in the console navigation, verify the information for the instance that you created.
6. Click **Open Dashboard**. When the dashboard loads, you see an overall view of all the activity in your account. You can use the search operators to filter your results by tags, sources, apps, or levels. You can also search for specific events or jump to a specific timeframe.
7. From the **All Apps** drop-down, select the instance of {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} that you want to track events for.


## List of runtime events
{: #at-runtime-events}

Check out the following table for a list of the runtime events that are sent to {{site.data.keyword.at_short}}.

{: caption="Table 2. Actions that can be tracked as authentication events at runtime" caption-side="top"}

## Analyzing runtime events
{: #at-runtime-analyze}

A user that generates a runtime event is identified as a GUID rather than by name or email. As the account owner, you can use the GUID to identify a specific user and then you can search to see all the events that the user triggered.
{: shortdesc}


The following scenario works only for Cloud Directory users. If the user is defined by an external IdP such as Google or Facebook, only that identity provider can interpret the GUID.
{: note}


### Extracting user information from the GUID
{: #at-extract-information}

An event in the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} console contains the following fields.

| Field | Value | Description |
|-----|----| ----- |
| initiator.id | cb967e0d-43c1-454a-968d-0efa24766846 | The tenant ID. |
| target.name | cloud_directory:34e1ea6d-cc02-4941-9462-7e9c5a40b360 | The user ID. |
{: caption="Table 3. Example fields that can be found in an event from the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} console" caption-side="top"}


To find the user information that aligns with the event GUID, use the following steps.

1. In the **Credentials** tab of the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} dashboard, copy, and save the information in the `apiKey` and `tenantID` fields. The tenant ID should match the ID of the event. If no credentials exist, create a set.

2. Obtain an IAM token for the `apiKey` by inserting the key into the following command:

   ```sh
   curl -k -X POST \
      --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
      --header "Accept: application/json" \
      --data-urlencode "grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey" \
      --data-urlencode "apikey=<apiKey>" \
      "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token"
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Copy the IAM token from the **access_token** field in the response.

4. Select a region. Learn more about the [available regions](/docs/appid?topic=appid-regions-endpoints).

5. Insert the IAM token, the tenant ID, and the user ID, into the following command to obtain the user information.

   ```sh
   curl -X GET
   --header 'Accept: application/json'
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <IAMToken>' \
   'https://<region>.appid.cloud.ibm.com/<tenantID>/cloud_directory/Users/<userID>'
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   You can also run this command by using the [management APIs](https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-ui/#/Config/getAuditStatus){: external}. Your output would look similar to the following JSON object:

   ```json
      {
      "displayName": "test test",
      "active": true,
      "userName": "test0001",
      "mfaContext": {},
      "emails": [
      {
         "value": "mytest@yahoo.com",
         "primary": true
      }
      ],
      "meta": {
      "lastLogin": "2018-12-10T16:05:36.665Z",
      "created": "2018-08-21T08:55:50.643Z",
      "location": "/v1/cb967e0d-43c1-454a-968d-0efa24766846/Users/34e1ea6d-cc02-4941-9462-7e9c5a40b360",
      "lastModified": "2018-12-10T16:05:36.675Z",
      "resourceType": "User"
      },
      "schemas": [
      "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
      ],
      "name": {
      "givenName": "test",
      "familyName": "test",
      "formatted": "test test"
      },
      "id": "34e1ea6d-cc02-4941-9462-7e9c5a40b360"
   }
   ```
   {: screen}





### Finding user-related events
{: #at-finding-user-events}

You can track the events of specific Cloud Directory users in {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} by using their email. Before you can begin tracking, the email must be mapped to a Cloud Directory GUID.


1. Obtain an IAM token, a tenant ID, and a region as described in the previous section.
2. Insert the IAM token, the tenant ID, and the email into the following command to obtain the user information.

   ```sh
   curl -X GET
   --header 'Accept: application/json'
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <IAMToken>'
   'https://<region>.appid.cloud.ibm.com/<tenantID>/users?email=<emailAddress>'
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   The email address must be escaped. For example, `myTest%40yahoo.com` instead of `myTest@yahoo.com`.
   {: note}

   Alternatively, you can use the [Management APIs](https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-ui/#/Config/getAuditStatus){: external}. Your output would look similar to the following JSON object:

   ```json
   {
      "users": [
      {
         "idp": "cloud_directory",
         "id": "1e123399-3499-4a5c-b5a9-93843a91dc80"
      },
      {
         "idp": "cloud_directory",
         "id": "2a7abbe5-0fce-402e-9ddf-265246b415c8"
      }
      ]
   }
   ```
   {: screen}

3. Search for a **cloud_directory:id** value in the **target.name_str** field in the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} console.
