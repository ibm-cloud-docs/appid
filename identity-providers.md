# Social
{: #social}

With {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}, you can configure social identity providers to set up a single sign-on experience for your app. By allowing a user to sign in with their social profiles, they no longer have to remember several different passwords for different applications.
{: shortdesc}


## Default configuration
{: #social-default}

{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} provides a default configuration to help you get up and running quickly with the service.
{: shortdesc}

Data is used when you engage in the Permitted Uses of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to adopting the policy for the collection and use of information in accordance with the outlined [privacy policy](/docs/appid?topic=appid-privacy-policy).
{: important}


When you configure {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}, Facebook, Google, and Cloud Directory are automatically enabled as identity providers. You can change the configuration at anytime. There are default credentials in place for Facebook and Google, but they are IBM credentials and should be used for testing whether to use the service only. Before you publish your app, update the configuration to your own credentials.

You are limited to 20 authentications with the default credentials per instance, per day. If you exceed this limit, `error_description=MaxNumberOfDefaultKeysUsageExceeded` appears at the end of the authentication process. 
{: note}
