App ID deprecation
:   Effective 31 March 2025 App ID will be deprecated. Starting on 1 May 2024, no new instances of App ID can be provisioned in any regions. You can continue to use your existing App ID instances until 31 March 2025. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted. It's recommended to migrate to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Security Verify for authentication to your workloads, including SAML Federation and App ID identities managed with App IDs Cloud Directory. For more information, see the deprecation details.

   Not sure if your {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance is using the Cloud Foundry service broker? In the [Cloud Foundry services](https://cloud.ibm.com/cloudfoundry/public){: external} section, check whether your {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance is listed as an alias. If your instance is already an alias, you do not need to take any action.  
   
   If your instance is not an alias and you want to keep it, please contact [IBM Cloud support](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} to discuss next steps.

## 8 August 2019
{: #appid-aug0819}
{: release-note}

Track runtime authentication events with {{site.data.keyword.at_short}}
:   Now you can track, manage, and analyze authentication events that are performed by your app users at runtime by [integrating {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}](/docs/appid?topic=appid-at-events#at-monitor-runtime). Releasing your secured custom, mobile, or web app to your users is only the beginning of your journey toward adoption. After your app is deployed, you need to have insights into how your users are interacting with your app. For example, the number and trends of active users. In regulatory markets, such as with HIPAA, you must have a way to share the detailed records of both successful and failed authentication events with auditors. With {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}, you can now have a very detailed view of runtime events that are related to user authentication.

Edit user profile information directly in the dashboard
:   You can now update profiles for users of your application through the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} dashboard. Then, you can use that information to personalize their experience of your app. For more information, see [user profiles](/docs/appid?topic=appid-profiles).

## 30 July 2019
{: #appid-jul3019}
{: release-note}

Create future user profiles through the dashboard
:   You can now start building profiles for users that you know will use your application in the future through the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} dashboard. For more information, see [Preregistering future users](/docs/appid?topic=appid-preregister).

Slack channel
:   Have questions while working with {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}? Get in touch directly with the development team on [Slack](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/get-help-with-ibm-cloud-app-id-related-questions-on-slack/){: external}!

The {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} Identity and Access Istio adapter
:   Centralize all your identity management in a single place with the App Identity and Access adapter. The adapter can be configured to work with any OIDC-compliant identity provider, which enables it to control authentication and authorization policies in all environments including both front and backend apps. And, it does it all without any change to your code or the need to redeploy your application. For more information, see [Securing multicloud apps with Istio](/docs/appid?topic=appid-istio-adapter).

Access user profile information through the GUI
:   View information about all your users that you can leverage to build personalized app experiences. For more information, see [Storing and accessing profiles](/docs/appid?topic=appid-profiles).

Cloud Directory: Automatically associate users with a profile
:   Automatically associate Cloud Directory users with an {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} profile as you create them. For more information, see [Managing users](/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-users).

## 18 May 2019
{: #appid-may1819}
{: release-note}

Cloud Directory: View user information
:   View information about your Cloud Directory users that you can leverage to build personalized app experiences. For more information, see [Viewing user information](/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-users#cd-user-info).

## 24 April 2019
{: #appid-apr2419}
{: release-note}

Version 4 of the runtime APIs
:   Update your apps! To further the standards on which {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} is based, we've made a few changes. With those changes, we were able to tighten interoperability within the OIDC workflow and broaden the frameworks that are able to use the service. For more information about the changes that you must make before September 2019, see the blog [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}: Updated runtime APIs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-app-id-v4-runtime-apis-update){: external}.

Cloud Directory: Single sign-on
:   Provide smooth authentication experiences between multiple web apps with single sign-on (SSO) for Cloud Directory. With SSO enabled, user's are not prompted to reenter their credentials the next time they attempt to access your app. Instead, they are automatically signed in to any of your apps that are protected by the same {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} instance. For more information, see [Single sign-on](/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-sso).

Updated dashboard
:   Navigate through your Cloud Directory information quickly! Using [IBM Design Thinking](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/){: external}, the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} dashboard has been redesigned to give you an even better user experience.

## 7 February 2019
{: #appid-feb0719}
{: release-note}

Cloud Directory: Multi-factor authentication - SMS
:   Require users to enter a second form of authentication during sign-in to increase the security of your app. With Cloud Directory, the first factor is the user's password that they would normally use. Then, the service sends the user a one-time code through SMS that the user must enter before they can gain access to your app. For more information, see [Multi-factor authentication](/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-mfa).

## 11 December 2018
{: #appid-dec1118}
{: release-note}

Cloud Directory: Multi-factor authentication - Email
:   Require users to enter a second form of authentication during sign-in to increase the security of your app. With Cloud Directory, the first factor is the user's password that they would normally use. Then, the service sends the user a one-time code through the email that is registered that the user must enter before they can gain access to your app. For more information, see [Multi-factor authentication](/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-mfa).

Cloud Directory: Password policies
:   Further enforce app security by specifying rules that users must adhere to when they create the password that they use to sign in. For example, you can set an advanced policy that dictates the number of times a password must change before a user can reuse a previous password. Or, you can prevent users from creating a password that contains their username or email address. For more information, see [Defining password policies](/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-strength).

## 17 March 2017
{: #appid-mar1717}
{: release-note}

Introducing {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}
:   IBM Cloud App ID allows you to easily add authentication to web and mobile apps. You no longer have to worry about setting up infrastructure for identity, ensuring geo-availability, and confirming compliance regulations. Instead, you can enhance your apps with advanced security capabilities like multifactor authentication and single sign-on.
